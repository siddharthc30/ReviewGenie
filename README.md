# Review Genie

Complete amazon product review analysis under one hood. Review Genie is a web application that helps users to understand more and provides insights about fellow customers and users regarding their opinion and thoughts on a certain product the user wants to purchase on Amazon(IN).

## Disclaimer
This project uses web scraping to collect information, I don't know if its right to host a web application that scrapes information from a popular website such as Amazon. I will soon find out a solution for this and host the project ASAP.
